He was sent to Middle-earth in the guise of an old man to assist the Free Peoples against the Dark Lord. Arriving at the Grey Havens around T.A. 1000, he was given the Elven Ring of Fire, Narya. Gandalf was one of five Istari, known to Men as wizards.\n\nGandalf endured many trials and adventures. A crucial member of the White Council, he formed relationships with great lords and leaders. Fond of Hobbits, Gandalf brought Bilbo on a quest. Known for his knowledge of history, languages, and magic, Gandalf inspired those he met, not using direct force against Sauron. Betrayed by Saruman, he replaced him in the order of the Istari.\n\nGandalf has been portrayed by William Squire (LOTR 1978), John Huston (The Hobbit 1977, Return of the King 1979), Michael Hordern and Norman Shelley (LOTR 1981, 1955 BBC radio). Key quotes include: \"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\" (to Bilbo) and \"May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks.\"\n\nGandalf's influence was crucial in defeating Sauron in the Third Age. He maintained a gentle, avuncular manner while revealing a glimpse of his inner power when needed.",

He was there from the very beginning, helping to make changes as the world slowly developed, and is widely considered the wisest of his kind. Gandalf, along with four other Maiar, eventually became the five incarnated wizards or Istari.\n\n2. Gandalf's transformation from \"the Grey\" to \"the White\" happens off-screen, for the most part, leaving a number of viewers perplexed as to how the wizard made the shift. This transformation was prompted by Saruman's betrayal, leaving the coveted position at the head of the White Council vacant, which Gandalf eventually filled. The second factor that contributed to Gandalf's transformation came after his death at the hands of the Balrog in the Mines of Moria. While Gandalf did manage to defeat the ancient beast, he too fell following their lengthy battle. He remained tethered to Middle-earth and his spirit wandered. He was eventually brought to Lothl\u00f3rien where his wounds were healed, and he was presented with a new, powerful staff and draped in white.\n\n3. Gandalf's key dates and events include becoming an Istari wizard, his fall in the Mines of Moria, his death and battle with the Balrog, his ascension as Gandalf the White, and his role as the leader of the White Council.\n\n4. Locations mentioned in relation to Gandalf's journey and transformation include Middle-earth, the Mines of Moria, and Lothl\u00f3rien.\n\n5. Gandalf's associated people or organizations include his fellow Istari wizards - Saruman and Radagast, the White Council, and various other groups and creatures within Middle-earth such as the elves in Lothl\u00f3rien.\n\n6.
